Reports usages of classes from packages that are not accessible inside the OSGi context.
  <p>For example, the inspection reports usages of classes located in .jar files that are not packaged as bundles, not exported by bundles,
    or not imported in manifest file (if applicable).</p>
  <p>Using such classes may cause "class not found" exceptions at runtime.</p>
<p>The inspection is disabled in tests by default. To enable it, use the <b>Check tests</b> option.</p>
