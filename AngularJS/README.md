# AngularJS Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs

This plugin provides support for AngularJS projects in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, GoLand, PhpStorm, PyCharm, Rider, RubyMine, and WebStorm.

It provides intelligent AngularJS-specific code completion, navigation and refactoring. 

The plugin bundles a collection of AngularJS code templates by [Pawel Kozlowski](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource) adapted to WebStorm by [Reto Ryter](https://github.com/rryter).

## Getting started

1. Install AngularJS plugin in *Preferences | Plugins - Install JetBrains plugins*.
2. Open your AngularJJ project.
3. Make sure that you have AngularJS library files in your project (for example, in the node_modules folder) â€“ this is required for the IDE to enable AngularJS support for this project.
