     * @see [NgModule guide](guide/providers)
     *
     * @usageNotes
     *
     * Dependencies whose providers are listed here become available for injection
     * into any component, directive, pipe or service that is a child of this injector.
     * The NgModule used for bootstrapping uses the root injector, and can provide dependencies
     * to any part of the app.
     *
     * A lazy-loaded module has its own injector, typically a child of the app root injector.
     * Lazy-loaded services are scoped to the lazy-loaded module's injector.
     * If a lazy-loaded module also provides the `UserService`, any component created
     * within that module's context (such as by router navigation) gets the local instance
     * of the service, not the instance in the root injector.
     * Components in external modules continue to receive the instance provided by their injectors.
     *
     * ### Example
     *
     * The following example defines a class that is injected in
     * the HelloWorld NgModule:
     *
     * ```
     * class Greeter {
     *    greet(name:string) {
     *      return 'Hello ' + name + '!';
     *    }
     * }
     *
     * @NgModule({
     *   providers: [
     *     Greeter
     *   ]
     * })
     * class HelloWorld {
     *   greeter:Greeter;
     *
     *   constructor(greeter:Greeter) {
     *     this.greeter = greeter;
     *   }
     * }
     * ```

     * ### Example
     *

     *

     * and re-exported.
     * For example, `ModuleA` imports `ModuleB`, and also exports
     * it, which makes the declarables from `ModuleB` available
     * wherever `ModuleA` is imported.
     *
     * ### Example
