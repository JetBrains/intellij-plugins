/**
 * @name AlertController
 * @description
 * An Alert is a dialog that presents users with information or collects
 * information from the user using inputs. An alert appears on top
 * of the app's content, and must be manually dismissed by the user before
 * they can resume interaction with the app. It can also optionally have a
 * `title`, `subTitle` and `message`.
 *
 * You can pass all of the alert's options in the first argument of
 * the create method: `create(opts)`. Otherwise the alert's instance
 * has methods to add options, such as `setTitle()` or `addButton()`.
 *
 *
 * ### Alert Buttons
 *
 * In the array of `buttons`, each button includes properties for its `text`,
 * and optionally a `handler`. If a handler returns `false` then the alert
 * will not automatically be dismissed when the button is clicked. All
 * buttons will show up in the order they have been added to the `buttons`
 * array, from left to right. Note: The right most button (the last one in
 * the array) is the main button.
 *
 * Optionally, a `role` property can be added to a button, such as `cancel`.
 * If a `cancel` role is on one of the buttons, then if the alert is
 * dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then it will fire the handler from
 * the button with a cancel role.
 *
 *
 * ### Alert Inputs
 *
 * Alerts can also include several different inputs whose data can be passed
 * back to the app. Inputs can be used as a simple way to prompt users for
 * information. Radios, checkboxes and text inputs are all accepted, but they
 * cannot be mixed. For example, an alert could have all radio button inputs,
 * or all checkbox inputs, but the same alert cannot mix radio and checkbox
 * inputs. Do note however, different types of "text"" inputs can be mixed,
 * such as `url`, `email`, `text`, etc. If you require a complex form UI
 * which doesn't fit within the guidelines of an alert then we recommend
 * building the form within a modal instead.
 *

 * ### Dismissing And Async Navigation
 *
 * After an alert has been dismissed, the app may need to also transition
 * to another page depending on the handler's logic. However, because multiple
 * transitions were fired at roughly the same time, it's difficult for the
 * nav controller to cleanly animate multiple transitions that may
 * have been kicked off asynchronously. This is further described in the
 * [`Nav Transition Promises`](../../nav/NavController) section. For alerts,
 * this means it's best to wait for the alert to finish its transition
 * out before starting a new transition on the same nav controller.
 *
 * In the example below, after the alert button has been clicked, its handler
 * waits on async operation to complete, *then* it uses `pop` to navigate
 * back a page in the same stack. The potential problem is that the async operation
 * may have been completed before the alert has even finished its transition
 * out. In this case, it's best to ensure the alert has finished its transition
 * out first, *then* start the next transition.
 *
 * ```ts
 * let alert = this.alertCtrl.create({
 *   title: 'Hello',
 *   buttons: [{
 *     text: 'Ok',
 *     handler: () => {
 *       // user has clicked the alert button
 *       // begin the alert's dismiss transition
 *       let navTransition = alert.dismiss();
 *
 *       // start some async method
 *       someAsyncOperation().then(() => {
 *         // once the async operation has completed
 *         // then run the next nav transition after the
 *         // first transition has finished animating out
 *
 *         navTransition.then(() => {
 *           this.nav.pop();
 *         });
 *       });
 *       return false;
 *     }
 *   }]
 * });
 *
 * alert.present();
 * ```
 *
 * It's important to note that the handler returns `false`. A feature of
 * button handlers is that they automatically dismiss the alert when their button
 * was clicked, however, we'll need more control regarding the transition. Because
 * the handler returns `false`, then the alert does not automatically dismiss
 * itself. Instead, you now have complete control of when the alert has finished
 * transitioning, and the ability to wait for the alert to finish transitioning
 * out before starting a new transition.
