/**
  * @name Typography
  * @module ionic
  * @description
  *
  * The Typography component is a simple component that can be used to style the text color of any element.
  * The `ion-text` attribute should be added to the element in order to pass a color from the Sass `$colors`
  * map and change the text color of that element.
  *
  * @usage
  *
  * ```html
  * <h1 ion-text color="secondary">H1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h1>
  *
  * <h2 ion-text color="primary">H2: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h2>
  *
  * <h3 ion-text color="light">H3: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h3>
  *
  * <h4 ion-text color="danger">H4: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h4>
  *
  * <h5 ion-text color="dark">H5: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h5>
  *
  * <h6 ion-text [color]="dynamicColor">H6: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h6>
  *
  * <p>
  *   I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand.
  *   Walking through the <sub ion-text color="danger">streets</sub> of Soho in the rain.
  *   He <i ion-text color="primary">was</i> looking for a place called Lee Ho Fook's.
  *   Gonna get a <a ion-text color="secondary">big dish of beef chow mein.</a>
  * </p>
  *
  * <p>
  *   He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent.
  *   Lately he's <sup ion-text color="primary">been</sup> overheard in Mayfair.
  *   Better stay away from him.
  *   He'll rip your lungs out, Jim.
  *   I'd like to meet his tailor.
  * </p>
  * ```
