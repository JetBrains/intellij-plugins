 * @name Haptic
 * @description
 * The `Haptic` class interacts with a haptic engine on the device, if
 * available. Generally, Ionic components use this under the hood, but you're
 * welcome to get a bit crazy with it if you fancy.
 *
 * Currently, this uses the Taptic engine on iOS.
 *
 * @usage
 * ```ts
 * export class MyClass{
 *  constructor(haptic: Haptic){
 *    haptic.selection();
 *  }
 * }
 *
