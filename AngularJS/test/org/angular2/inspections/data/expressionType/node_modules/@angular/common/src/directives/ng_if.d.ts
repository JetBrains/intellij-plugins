/**
 * A structural directive that conditionally includes a template based on the value of
 * an expression coerced to Boolean.
 * When the expression evaluates to true, Angular renders the template
 * provided in a `then` clause, and when  false or null,
 * Angular renders the template provided in an optional `else` clause. The default
 * template for the `else` clause is blank.
 *
 * A [shorthand form](guide/structural-directives#the-asterisk--prefix) of the directive,
 * `*ngIf="condition"`, is generally used, provided
 * as an attribute of the anchor element for the inserted template.
 * Angular expands this into a more explicit version, in which the anchor element
 * is contained in an `<ng-template>` element.
 *
 * Simple form with shorthand syntax:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition">Content to render when condition is true.</div>
 * ```
 *
 * Simple form with expanded syntax:
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template [ngIf]="condition"><div>Content to render when condition is
 * true.</div></ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with an "else" block:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">Content to render when condition is true.</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Shorthand form with "then" and "else" blocks:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
 * <ng-template #thenBlock>Content to render when condition is true.</ng-template>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with storing the value locally:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition as value; else elseBlock">{{value}}</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when value is null.</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The `*ngIf` directive is most commonly used to conditionally show an inline template,
 * as seen in the following  example.
 * The default `else` template is blank.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}
 *
 * ### Showing an alternative template using `else`
 *
 * To display a template when `expression` evaluates to false, use an `else` template
 * binding as shown in the following example.
 * The `else` binding points to an `<ng-template>`  element labeled `#elseBlock`.
 * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view, but is typically placed right after
 * `ngIf` for readability.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}
 *
 * ### Using an external `then` template
 *
 * In the previous example, the then-clause template is specified inline, as the content of the
 * tag that contains the `ngIf` directive. You can also specify a template that is defined
 * externally, by referencing a labeled `<ng-template>` element. When you do this, you can
 * change which template to use at runtime, as shown in the following example.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}
 *
 * ### Storing a conditional result in a variable
 *
 * You might want to show a set of properties from the same object. If you are waiting
 * for asynchronous data, the object can be undefined.
 * In this case, you can use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local
 * variable as shown in the the following example.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}
 *
 * This code uses only one `AsyncPipe`, so only one subscription is created.
 * The conditional statement stores the result of `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.
 * You can then bind the local `user` repeatedly.
 *
 * The conditional displays the data only if `userStream` returns a value,
 * so you don't need to use the
 * [safe-navigation-operator](guide/template-syntax#safe-navigation-operator) (`?.`)
 * to guard against null values when accessing properties.
 * You can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.
 *
 * ### Shorthand syntax
 *
 * The shorthand syntax `*ngIf` expands into two separate template specifications
 * for the "then" and "else" clauses. For example, consider the following shorthand statement,
 * that is meant to show a loading page while waiting for data to be loaded.
 *
 * ```
 * <div class="hero-list" *ngIf="heroes else loading">
 *  ...
 * </div>
 *
 * <ng-template #loading>
 *  <div>Loading...</div>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * You can see that the "else" clause references the `<ng-template>`
 * with the `#loading` label, and the template for the "then" clause
 * is provided as the content of the anchor element.
 *
 * However, when Angular expands the shorthand syntax, it creates
 * another `<ng-template>` tag, with `ngIf` and `ngIfElse` directives.
 * The anchor element containing the template for the "then" clause becomes
 * the content of this unlabeled `<ng-template>` tag.
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template [ngIf]="hero-list" [ngIfElse]="loading">
 *  <div class="hero-list">
 *   ...
 *  </div>
 * </ng-template>
 *
 * <ng-template #loading>
 *  <div>Loading...</div>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * The presence of the implicit template object has implications for the nesting of
 * structural directives. For more on this subject, see
 * [Structural Directives](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#one-per-element).
