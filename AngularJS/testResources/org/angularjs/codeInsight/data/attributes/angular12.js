/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModel
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngModel` directive binds an `input`,`select`, `textarea` (or custom form control) to a
 * property on the scope using {@link ngModel.NgModelController NgModelController},
 * which is created and exposed by this directive.
 *
 * `ngModel` is responsible for:
 *
 * - Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as `input`, `textarea` or `select`
 *   require.
 * - Providing validation behavior (i.e. required, number, email, url).
 * - Keeping the state of the control (valid/invalid, dirty/pristine, validation errors).
 * - Setting related css classes on the element (`ng-valid`, `ng-invalid`, `ng-dirty`, `ng-pristine`) including animations.
 * - Registering the control with its parent {@link ng.directive:form form}.
 *
 * Note: `ngModel` will try to bind to the property given by evaluating the expression on the
 * current scope. If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created
 * implicitly and added to the scope.
 *
 * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - [https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes]
 *
 * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}
 *    - {@link input[text] text}
 *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}
 *    - {@link input[radio] radio}
 *    - {@link input[number] number}
 *    - {@link input[email] email}
 *    - {@link input[url] url}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}
 *
 * # CSS classes
 * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element
 * depending on the validity of the model.
 *
 *  - `ng-valid` is set if the model is valid.
 *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the model is invalid.
 *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the model is pristine.
 *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the model is dirty.
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed
 * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,
 * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.
 * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and
 * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-input {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-input.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
 * <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true">
     <file name="index.html">
       <script>
        function Ctrl($scope) {
          $scope.val = '1';
        }
       </script>
       <style>
         .my-input {
           -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;
           transition:all linear 0.5s;
           background: transparent;
         }
         .my-input.ng-invalid {
           color:white;
           background: red;
         }
       </style>
       Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.
       Integer is a valid value.
       <form name="testForm" ng-controller="Ctrl">
         <input ng-model="val" ng-pattern="/^\d+$/" name="anim" class="my-input" />
       </form>
     </file>
 * </example>
