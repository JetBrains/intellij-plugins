Reports a Vue component <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#data">data</a> property that is not a function. Suggests wrapping an object literal with a function.
<p>When defining a component, <code>data</code> must be declared as a function that returns the initial data object, because the same definition will be used for creating numerous instances. If a plain object is still used for <code>data</code>, that very object will be shared by reference across all instances created! With a <code>data</code> function,  every time a new instance is created we can simply call it to return a fresh copy of the initial data.
