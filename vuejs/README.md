# Vue.js Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs

This plugin is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, AppCode, CLion, Gogland and Rider.

It provides intelligent  support for the Vue.js framework including:

Recognition of the .vue file type.
Support for script, style, and template blocks in .vue files. PhpStorm by default provides code completion for ECMAScript 6 inside script blocks and for CSS inside style block. PhpStorm also recognizes the lang attribute inside the script and style tags and allows you to use TypeScript, Pug, and CSS preprocessors instead.
Completion for Vue directives in templates.
