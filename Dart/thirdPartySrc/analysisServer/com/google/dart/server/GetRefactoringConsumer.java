   * @param initialProblems The initial status of the refactoring, i.e. problems related to the
   *          context in which the refactoring is requested. The array will be empty if there are no
   *          known problems.
   * @param optionsProblems The options validation status, i.e. problems in the given options, such
   *          as light-weight validation of a new name, flags compatibility, etc. The array will be
   *          empty if there are no known problems.
   * @param finalProblems The final status of the refactoring, i.e. problems identified in the
   *          result of a full, potentially expensive validation and / or change creation. The array
   *          will be empty if there are no known problems.
   * @param feedback Data used to provide feedback to the user. The structure of the data is
   *          dependent on the kind of refactoring being created. The data that is returned is
   *          documented in the section titled Refactorings, labeled as “Feedback”.
   * @param change The changes that are to be applied to affect the refactoring. This field will be
   *          omitted if there are problems that prevent a set of changes from being computed, such
   *          as having no options specified for a refactoring that requires them, or if only
   *          validation was requested.
   * @param potentialEdits The ids of source edits that are not known to be valid. An edit is not
   *          known to be valid if there was insufficient type information for the server to be able
   *          to determine whether or not the code needs to be modified, such as when a member is
   *          being renamed and there is a reference to a member from an unknown type. This field
   *          will be omitted if the change field is omitted or if there are no potential edits for
   *          the refactoring.
