/**
 * Packet interceptor that will intercept presence packets sent to the MUC service to indicate
 * that the user wants to be a deaf occupant. A user can only indicate that he wants to be a
 * deaf occupant while joining the room. It is not possible to become deaf or stop being deaf
 * after the user joined the room.<p>
 *
 * Deaf occupants will not get messages broadcasted to all room occupants. However, they will
 * be able to get private messages, presences, IQ packets or room history. To use this
 * functionality you will need to send the message
 * {@link MultiUserChat#addPresenceInterceptor(org.jivesoftware.smack.PacketInterceptor)} and
 * pass this interceptor as the parameter.<p>
 *
 * Note that this is a custom extension to the MUC service so it may not work with other servers
 * than Wildfire.
