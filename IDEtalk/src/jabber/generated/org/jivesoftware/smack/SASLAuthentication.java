/**
 * This class is responsible authenticating the user using SASL, binding the resource
 * to the connection and establishing a session with the server.<p>
 *
 * Once TLS has been negotiated (i.e. the connection has been secured) it is possible to
 * register with the server, authenticate using Non-SASL or authenticate using SASL. If the
 * server supports SASL then Smack will first try to authenticate using SASL. But if that
 * fails then Non-SASL will be tried.<p>
 *
 * The server may support many SASL mechanisms to use for authenticating. Out of the box
 * Smack provides SASL PLAIN but it is possible to register new SASL Mechanisms. Use
 * {@link #registerSASLMechanism(int, String, Class)} to add new mechanisms. See
 * {@link SASLMechanism}.<p>
 *
 * Once the user has been authenticated with SASL, it is necessary to bind a resource for
 * the connection. If no resource is passed in {@link #authenticate(String, String, String)}
 * then the server will assign a resource for the connection. In case a resource is passed
 * then the server will receive the desired resource but may assign a modified resource for
 * the connection.<p>
 *
 * Once a resource has been binded and if the server supports sessions then Smack will establish
 * a session so that instant messaging and presence functionalities may be used.
