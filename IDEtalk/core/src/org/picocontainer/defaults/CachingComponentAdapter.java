 * {@link ComponentAdapter} implementation that caches the component instance.

 * <p>
 * This adapter supports components with a lifecycle, as it is a {@link LifecycleManager lifecycle manager}
 * which will apply the delegate's {@link LifecycleStrategy lifecycle strategy} to the cached component instance.
 * The lifecycle state is maintained so that the component instance behaves in the expected way:
 * it can't be started if already started, it can't be started or stopped if disposed, it can't
 * be stopped if not started, it can't be disposed if already disposed.
