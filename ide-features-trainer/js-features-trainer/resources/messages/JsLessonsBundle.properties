js.editor.basics.module.name=Editor Basics
js.editor.basics.module.description=Get the hang of the editor essentials \u2013 start writing better code and saving time on common tasks from day one.

js.editor.completion.title=Code Completion
js.editor.completion.choose.lookup=<ide/> is full of features that help you write better code and increase your productivity. \
  Let\u2019s start with code completion. It enables you to code faster by completing keywords and symbols from language APIs and project \
  dependencies. Type {0} and press {1} to autocomplete {2}.
js.editor.completion.choose.method=So, code completion shows context-aware suggestions as you type. \
  To add one of these suggestions, you can use {0} like we just did, or press {1} to replace an existing item. \
  Now add a {2} after {3}, then type {4} and autocomplete the {5} method with {0}.
js.editor.completion.parameter.info=The tooltip ({0}) we\u2019ve got after placing the caret inside {1} lets you quickly look up the names of \
  parameters in methods and functions. In some situations, you may want to review more detailed documentation. Let\u2019s do it now by pressing {2}.
js.editor.completion.add.parameter=This is how you can look up JavaScript documentation right in <ide/>. Now add {0} inside {1} to continue.
js.editor.completion.console.log.argument=Finally, let\u2019s complete the {0} statement. \
  Place the caret inside {1} on the line 8 and add {2} using code completion.
js.editor.completion.next=That\u2019s it for this lesson. To start the next one, click the button below or use {0}.

js.editor.code.editing.tips.and.tricks.title=Code Editing Tips and Tricks
js.editor.code.editing.reformat.start=Let''s go over some tips and tricks that can help you edit code a lot faster. \
  For starters, there''s no need to manually fix code formatting with <ide/>. Reformat the code with {0}.
js.editor.code.editing.select.word=Now let\u2019s see how to quickly select pieces of code in a file. \
  Press {0} a few times to fully select the second tr element (lines 14-18).
js.editor.code.editing.comment.delete.unselect.move.up.1=Now that you''ve selected the code, you can (un)comment it out ({0}), delete it \
  ({1}), or shrink the selection ({2}).
js.editor.code.editing.comment.delete.unselect.move.up.2=Another thing you can do is move this code up or down the file. Let\u2019s move it up with {0}.
js.editor.code.editing.multi.caret.1=Next up is multi-caret editing. Use it to save time as you modify code in several places at once. \
  Place the caret inside the first {0} tag (line 10). Then select all {1} tags inside the same tr element (lines 10-12): press {2} six \
  times until all the necessary tags are selected.
js.editor.code.editing.multi.caret.2=Let''s replace {0} with {1} and press {2} to exit the multi-caret mode.
js.editor.code.editing.duplicate.delete.comment=Finally, let\u2019s quickly try the most popular line actions, such as duplicate line, \
  delete line, or comment it out. Use {0} to duplicate the selected line now. Then press {1} and {2} to try the other line actions.
js.editor.code.editing.next=That''s it for this lesson. Click the button below to start the next one or use  {0}.

js.editor.code.inspection.title=Code Inspections
js.editor.code.inspection.intro=As you work in the editor, <ide/> constantly analyzes your code, detects various problems in it, and suggests \
  how it can be improved. The opened file has two highlighted problems on lines 4 and 5. Let\u2019s check what they are by pressing {0}.
js.editor.code.inspection.show.intentions.1=You can also use {0} to jump from one error to another. \
  Or, you can explore the found problems by hovering over them.
js.editor.code.inspection.show.intentions.2=In this file, the IDE has located an unresolved variable \u2013 one that wasn''t defined anywhere in the code. \
  It suggests creating a new one, {0}, as one of the possible fixes, but we need to add a parameter book instead. \
  Place the caret on {1} and press {2} to see the full list of fixes.
js.editor.code.inspection.run.intention=Let\u2019s select {0} and press {1}.
js.editor.code.inspection.checkmark=If you now look at the top right-hand corner of the editor, you\u2019ll see a green checkmark ({0}) \
  confirming the file has no more problems. However, there\u2019s still a minor detail that can be optimized to make the code shorter. \
  Place the caret on {1} (line 3) and press {2}.
js.editor.code.inspection.make.shorter=Now let\u2019s make our function expression shorter. Select the {0} quick-fix and press {1}.
js.editor.code.inspection.next=That\u2019s it for this lesson. Click the button below to start the next one or use  {0}.

js.editor.navigation.title=Navigation
js.editor.navigation.recent.files=Let\u2019s start with navigating around a project. Press {0} to call up the {1} popup.
js.editor.navigation.choose.structure=With this popup, you can quickly jump between recent files and IDE tool windows. One of those tool \
  windows can assist you with navigating around a single file. Click the {0} tab to learn more about it.
js.editor.navigation.activate.structure=The {0} tool window can help you examine a file faster. It provides an overview of its \
  structure and lets you jump to a specific item simply by typing its name. Start typing {1} anywhere in the tool window area, press {2}, \
  and then press {3} to close the panel and jump to the code.
js.editor.navigation.find.usages=As a result of our actions, the caret has moved to {0} (line 9). \
  Let\u2019s leave it there and press {1} to open another tool window that can help you quickly find usages of any item.
js.editor.navigation.hide.tool.window=Now you can see the usages of giveTreat across the whole project and the libraries. \
  Let\u2019s close the tool window with {0}.
js.editor.navigation.search.everywhere=Now press {0} twice to meet another feature that can help you search faster.
js.editor.navigation.search.everywhere.tabs=This is the {0} popup. It lets you instantly find any action, file, class or symbol, and shows \
  all the matches in one place. If you want to run a more specific search, you can press {1} to switch from {2} to any other tab, such as \
  {3} or {4}. Or you can use a shortcut to open a specific tab that you need. Let\u2019s try the latter with {5}.
js.editor.navigation.search.action=Now that we\u2019re on the {0} tab, let\u2019s start typing {1} in the search bar to look up a shortcut for \
  another useful navigation feature.
js.editor.navigation.go.to.declaration=Notice the {0} next to <strong>Go to Declaration or Usages</strong> \u2013 it shows you usages for the \
  definition and vice versa. Let\u2019s close the popup, place the caret on {1} (line 16), and press {0} to look for its declaration.
js.editor.navigation.keymap.reference=Congratulations! You\u2019ve made it to the end of {0}. Print out the <a href="{1}">keymap reference</a> \
  to have all the shortcuts handy as you make yourself at home in <ide/>. Click the button below to move to the next module.

js.editor.refactorings.title=Refactoring Your Code
js.editor.refactorings.this=<ide/> has a <a href=''{0}''>number of refactorings</a> that can automatically restructure existing code without \
  changing its behavior across the entire project. Let''s preview the list of refactorings available for the {1} parameter. \
  Press {2} or select {3} from the main menu.
js.editor.refactorings.rename=With {0}, you don''t need to memorize all the refactorings or their shortcuts. \
  Click {1} to see one of the most popular refactorings in action.
js.editor.refactorings.rename.apply=Rename the {0} parameter to {1} and press {2}. This action will apply the changes across all files in the project.
js.editor.refactorings.shortcut=Well done! Let''s try to refactor code by using a shortcut. \
  Place the caret at the {0} property (line 4) and press {1}.
js.editor.refactoring.replace=Now replace all two occurrences with the {0} variable named {1}.
js.editor.refactoring.select.expression=Let''s create a new variable, {0} that will contain {1}. \
  Select the {1} expression from the list and press {2}.
js.editor.refactorings.next=You''ve just explored two ways to refactor code in <ide/>. Print out the <a href="{0}">keymap reference</a> \
  if you prefer using shortcuts, or simply keep using the {1} menu. Click the button below to start the next lesson or use {2}.

js.getting.started.module.name=Getting Started with Testing
js.getting.started.module.description=Find out how to streamline unit testing in {0} by going through an example using Jest.

js.testing.jest.title=Fundamentals of Testing in {0}
js.testing.jest.prepare=With <ide/>, all testing workflows become easier. Let\u2019s see how. For this module, we\u2019ll use \
  <a href="{0}">Jest</a> and one of <a href="{1}">its sample projects</a> as an example, so please <strong>make sure you have Jest and npm/Yarn \
  installed</strong> on your machine (see <a href="{2}">this</a> webpage for more information). We\u2019ll start by creating a run/debug configuration, \
  which is going to be Jest-specific. On the main menu, select {3}. Then click {4}, add the {5} configuration with the default \
  parameters, and press {6} to save it.
js.testing.jest.run=So, now the new {0} configuration is selected by default. Let\u2019s click the {1} ({2}) button right next to it.
js.testing.jest.navigate.1=Now we can see the {0} tool window with the test results and a stack trace for the failed tests coming from a \
  test runner in it. Apart from simply tracking the test progress, you can do a lot of other things here. You can rerun all ({1}) or only \
  failed ({2}) tests, view passed tests ({3}), or enable the <a href="{4}">watch mode</a> to automatically rerun tests on changes.
js.testing.jest.navigate.2=You can also quickly find a specific test in {0}. Let\u2019s try it now: place the caret anywhere in the {0} area, \
  type {1}, and press {2} to jump to our test.
js.testing.jest.fix.test.1=If you now hover over {0} in the editor, \
  you\u2019ll see a popup explaining why the test failed. From there, you can also debug a test if needed.
js.testing.jest.fix.test.2=Let\u2019s now replace the incorrect value used for {0}: on line 6, replace {1} with {2}.
js.testing.jest.re.run.test.1=Now that we have the right value for the expected result, we can rerun our test. \
  See the {0} icon on the left of the test in the editor? This icon not only shows you the test status for the tests you\u2019ve \
  run recently, but also lets you quickly run and debug a specific test.
js.testing.jest.re.run.test.2=Click it and select {0}.
js.testing.jest.success.run.coverage.1=Great job! Our test has successfully passed.
js.testing.jest.success.run.coverage.2=Let\u2019s take a look at another handy tool. Click the {0} icon located next to the run/debug configurations menu.
js.testing.jest.coverage.result=This is how you can quickly build a code coverage report showing how many files were covered with tests, \
  including the percentage of lines that were covered in those files. Now let\u2019s close the coverage report with {0}.
js.testing.jest.end=Congratulations! You\u2019ve made it to the end of this module. Most of what we\u2019ve learned also applies to the other test \
  runners that <ide/> supports (except for code coverage and the watch mode). For more tips and tricks about testing apps with Jest, please \
  take a look at <a href="{0}">this</a> blog post. If you use other test runners, you may want to explore our <a href="{1}">web help</a>.
