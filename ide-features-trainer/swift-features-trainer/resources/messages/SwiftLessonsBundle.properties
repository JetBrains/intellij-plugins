swift.navigation.search.find.usages.var=This is not very helpful, is it? In real code, we probably want to search for the {0} variable, without including class names, method names, or any other code constructs. Try pressing {1} and then {2}.
swift.navigation.search.find.usages.var.result=Now, AppCode shows only actual usages of the {0} variable.
swift.navigation.search.find.usages.proto=The same workflow applies to any other code construct. Press {0} \u2192 {1} to find all the usages of the {2} protocol in the project.
swift.navigation.search.find.usages.method=Now let''s find all usages of the method {0}. Press {1} \u2192 {2} again.
swift.navigation.search.rule=The simple rule is: identify the symbol you need to find, instead of which piece of text you need to find. <strong>Find Usages</strong> works for any code construct in the project context, so you will find all the usages in the whole codebase.
swift.navigation.search.text.search=Of course, sometimes you don''t know what exactly you''re looking for, and you want to find as many matches as possible by searching for some text. In this case, use {0} to search in the current file, or use {1} to search in the whole project.
swift.navigation.search.everything=What if you want to search for some text in symbols, file names, or even IDE settings and menu items? Press <shortcut>Double\u21E7</shortcut> to open the <strong>Search Everywhere</strong> dialog.

swift.refactoring.change.signature.exec=Press {0} to change the {1} name to {2}.
swift.refactoring.change.signature.exec.again=Press {0} again. Click the row with the {1} parameter and change it to {2}, or add an internal parameter name.
