# Angular Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs

This plugin provides support for Angular projects in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, GoLand, PhpStorm, PyCharm, Rider, RubyMine, and WebStorm.

It provides intelligent Angular-specific code completion, navigation and refactoring. 

The plugin bundles a collection of Angular code templates by [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa), adapted to WebStorm by [Reto Ryter](https://github.com/rryter).

## Getting started

1. If you’re using WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm or PyCharm Pro, the plugin is already installed and enabled in your IDE.
In GoLand, Rider or RubyMine, install AngularJS plugin in *Preferences | Plugins - Install JetBrains plugins*.
2. Open your Angular project.
3. Make sure that you have Angular library files in your project (for example, in the node_modules folder) – this is required for the IDE to enable Angular support for this project.

[Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/angular.html) you can find more information on using Angular in the IDE.
