Under path contrib/Angular/resources/org/angular2/cli/ng-packages.json,
there is an ng-packages.json file kept for backward compatibility.
This is due to a static link from AngularCliSchematicsRegistryServiceImpl
pointing to a file on GitHub repository master.

It should have the same contents as the `ng-packages.json` file in this folder.
